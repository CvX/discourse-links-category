# Discourse Links Category

This plugin for [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) provides a new 'Link' category for topics. Whenever this category is selected you'll have a new URL field next to the topic title. Think Hacker/Designer News.

You can see it in action on http://beta.danskdynamit.com.

# Discourse Links Category

This plugin for [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) provides a new 'Link' category for topics. This can be any category on your site. Whenever this category is chosen for a topic you'll have a new URL field next to the title field. Think Hacker News.

You can see it in action on http://danskdynamit.com.
